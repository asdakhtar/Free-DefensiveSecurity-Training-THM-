# Free-DefensiveSecurity-Training-THM- ( https://tryhackme.com/resources/blog/free-defensive-security-training )

I'll be adding some easy Explanations and some insights about the rooms that are free to read and for practical use from TryHackMe!
HERE I'LL BE ADDING THE ROOMS FROM "GETTING STARTED MODULE" THE NEXT MODULES WOULD BE ADDED AS TEXT FILES IN SAME BRANCH


@@ ROOM1 -
Starting out in CyberSec [https://tryhackme.com/room/startingoutincybersec?ref=blog.tryhackme.com] 
DATE- I ALREADY DID THIS IN PREVIOUS MONTHS
~~ TASK1=
This room is just basic info for new people to know about the teams and basic job roles.
Offensive security focuses on legally attacking systems to find vulnerabilities—ideal for analytical, curious minds; Penetration testers need broad skills in web, network, scripting, and cloud security (AWS/Azure).
-Q- What is the name of the career role that is legally employed to find vulnerabilities in applications?
-A- PENETRATION TESTER
~~ TASK2=
Defensive security focuses on detecting, analyzing, and stopping cyberattacks—ideal for analytical problem-solvers. Roles like Security Analyst, Incident Responder, and Malware Analyst require deep tech understanding and forensic skills.
-Q- What is the name of the role who's job is to identify attacks against an organisation?
-A- SECURITY ANALYST

@@ ROOM2 -Defensive Security Intro [https://tryhackme.com/room/defensivesecurityintro] DATE - I DID THIS PREVIOUSLY
Sure! Here's a condensed summary from the TryHackMe Defensive Security info room:
~~ TASK 1= Introduction to Defensive Security:** Defensive security focuses on monitoring, detecting, and responding to cyber threats using tools like SIEM and threat intelligence.  
-Q- Which team focuses on defensive security?
-A- BLUE TEAM
~~ TASK 2= Areas of Defensive Security:** Key areas include SOC operations, DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response), malware analysis, and threat hunting.  
1-Q- What would you call a team of cyber security professionals that monitors a network and its systems for malicious events?
-A- Security Operations Center
2-Q- What does DFIR stand for?
-A- Digital Forensics and Incident Response
3-Q- Which kind of malware requires the user to pay money to regain access to their files?
-A- ransomware
~~ TASK 3= Practical Example of Defensive Security:** Analysts use SIEM dashboards to inspect alerts, trace malicious IPs, and block threats via firewall rules.
-Q- What is the flag that you obtained by following along?
-A- THM{THREAT-BLOCKED}

~~TASK 8 = Threat versus Risk  
Differentiate between a **threat** (potential harm) and a **risk** (likelihood + impact of that harm).
~~TASK 9 = Conclusion  
Wrap up the room with a recap of key security principles and their role in building secure systems.
